\chapter{Team 6 Agent Design}\label{team_6_agent_design}

Our agent has been designed to maximise both individual and collective ability. This has been achieved by maintaining four core beliefs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Greed should be punished
    \item Irrationality should be punished
    \item Maintaining a team of semi-greedy, semi-rational agents is best for the collective
    \item Collective Intelligence and Group Think should be used under the right conditions
\end{itemize}
With these beliefs in mind, an overall strategy was devised:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use a Social Capital system as the main driver for agent decision making
    \item Define a robust set of objectives for the Social Capital system
    \item Integrate learning into the system
\end{itemize}

\section{Social Capital System}

The main driver behind our agent's decision making is the Social Capital system. The system was designed with two key objective in mind - effectively managing finite common pool resources (avoiding the tragedy of the commons), and maximising self and collective utility. When combined, these improve the chance of escaping the pit. The system is also subject to three constraints - maximising agent state, obtaining a favourable loot distribution, and electing the most favourable leader.

To meet the requirements set out, five values are maintained for each agent in the game. The values are continuously updated as the game evolves. The values are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Generosity (G)
    \item Bravery (B)
    \item Similarity (Si)
    \item Leadership (L)
    \item Trust (T)
\end{itemize}
